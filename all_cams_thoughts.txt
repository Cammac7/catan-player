-Optimize for 5 total settlements (with lowest road cost, 5 total roads)
	-switch and optimize for city if:
		-You have 5 settlements
		-your odds to be able to build a city by the time it's your turn(based on projected resources and current resources) is x% more likely than settlement, AND you have at least two settlements`
-You can KNOW at any point your odds of getting each resource (where to track this?)
-Would need data but I'm sure there's a "If no one has biggest road or road of X length by round Y, sprint for biggest road (at end)?
	-it may be adventageous to get it in the beginning to force other players to burn resources to get it?

Turn Order:
1. Try to build
2. try to trade
3. try to build
^^Only build what you're trying to optimize for
4. if at or over 7 cards, build or trade anything to get you to 7 or under
	-even development cards
	-Look into this, maybe it's actually statistically better to take the risk and hold

-Dont always escalate trade to 2:1 or 3:1 even if it's adventageous so p opponents don't anticipate it and always deny your first trade

Social Engineering:
-If someone tried to rob you, you can figure out what they need and throw someone else under the bus. ("You're robbing me? Mark has the most clay")
